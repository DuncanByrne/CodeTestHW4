In this assignment we had to make a quiz for our code that could be answered by our classmates with a scoreboard to see who ranked the highest.
I did this by using my previous knowledge in HTML and CSS along with my newfound knowledge of JavaScript. To get the information needed in this assignment,
we needed to create variables and functions while using things like getElementById, setInterval, setItem, getItem etc. We used these to create what gets
controlled by our functions.
